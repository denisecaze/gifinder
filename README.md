# Gifinder

## Motivation
This was the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) after a twelve hours hackathon at Laboratoria bootcamp. Working in squads of five students, the challenge was to create an app similar to Tinder, but only to choose your favorite gifs, using Firebase to store user's data, Giphy API and Hammer library to apply the swipe functionality.
